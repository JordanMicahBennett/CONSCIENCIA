CONSCIENCIA
===========
A language that confluences computation and common sense
http://www.consciencia-language.tk/




HOW WAS CONSCIENCIA SYNTHESIZED? 
===========
Whence consciencia's underylings (grammer,lexer)
were forged in use of language building tools (lex,cup), 
consciencia's user end was composed in a deep graphics frame work [uni-code(tm)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/UNI_CODE-DEEP-UI-ENGINE)


TRADITIONAL SYNTAX TREE
===========

CLEAN COMFORTABLE USER END
===========
Pure white frontent, powered by (uni-code(tm)).




CLEAN COMPUTE WINDOW
===========
Consciencia's compute window (accessed via build button toggle in core screen)
is written in uni-code(tm)'s deep graphics framework. 
All output and computations blend into consciencia's compute window

CONSCIENCIA COMMANDS
===========
basic operations
[+]Summate amongst exp1 and exp2. [return sum]
[-]Differ amongst exp1 and exp2. [return difference]
[*]Produce amongst exp1 and exp2.  [return product]
[/]Quote amongst exp1 and exp2. [return quotient]

[%]Expound amongst exp1 and value. [return exponent] 
[>]Trancends? amongst exp1 and exp2. [return boolean] ( is exp1 greater than exp2? )
[<]Relents? amongst exp1 and exp2. [return boolean] ( is exp1 lesser than exp2? )
